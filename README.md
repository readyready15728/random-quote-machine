# Random Quote Machine
## Just what it says: a random quote machine

This is my first ever React code outside of a tutorial, a suggested project on
Free Code Camp. It's not much but it works and it's got Bootstrap integration.

I am well-aware that my API key is exposed in the code: without my own backend
there are two ways to go through the API, which is on HTTP no less, and both
of them expose the key in frontend code. I have simply chosen the easier of
the two so I'm just asking the reader nicely not hog all my 1000 requiests per
day by abusing the key.
